<p>As the most complex subway system in the world, however, the NYC

(free crossover points) in mind, we now turn our attention to evaluating
the overall accessibility performance of the city’s subway stations.</p>

<p>From the plot, we can see that stations with the highest
accessibility levels are less likely to have both ADA compliance and
<code>free_crossover</code> points, while the lowest accessibility
stations are more likely to have neither. In scenarios where stations
only offer <code>free_crossover</code>, the more accessible a station is
overall, the less likely it is to only have that one feature. However,
most of the stations only meet the basic amenity standard of providing
free crossover.</p>

<p>Next, we examine where high- and low-accessibility stations are
located in the city. It appears that areas with a high concentration of
low-accessibility stations include Downtown Manhattan, the Bronx, and
Downtown Brooklyn.</p>

<p>From the model’s results, we speculate that restroom_accessibility
has a significant effect on the clustering outcomes. Most
high-accessibility stations have fully accessible restrooms nearby,
while medium- and low-accessibility stations often lack accessible
restrooms or have missing data for those amenities. This finding
supports our speculation that <code>restroom_accessibility</code> is a
dominant factor in the model.</p>
