<h3>Operational Restrooms Across NYC</h3>
<p>Although public restrooms are readily available to us, they are not
always usable. This could be due to malfunctions of the restroom or the
entirety of the restroom is closed due to the location being closed for
holiday or for the season. Analyzing the available of operational
restrooms in NYC may help to prevent individuals from going to public
restroom while worrying it may not be available.</p>
<div id="the-intended-final-products" class="section level4">
<h4>The intended final products</h4>
<p>Our final product will be a comprehensive webpage with four main
sections: an introduction to the project and dataset, data
visualizations comparing restroom conditions, an interactive map of
operational restrooms, and a detailed report with findings and future
recommendations. This will allow users to explore restroom accessibility
and discover patterns in restroom availability across different areas of
NYC.</p>
</div>
<div
id="the-anticipated-data-sources-and-planned-analyses-visualizations-coding-challenges"
class="section level4">
<h4>The anticipated data sources and planned analyses / visualizations /
coding challenges</h4>
<p>We will source our data from NYC Open Data on Public Restrooms and
the train station dataset from our class resources. Planned analyses
will include mapping operational restrooms by location using latitude
and longitude, visualizing accessibility across NYC train stations, and
comparing restrooms by accessibility and gender accommodations. A
significant challenge may be aligning columns from the two datasets for
accurate analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-planned-timeline" class="section level4">
<h4>The planned timeline</h4>
<p>Our timeline includes completing data tidying by 11/22/2024,
visualizations by 11/30/2024, the webpage by 12/06/2024, and a recorded
presentation by 12/12/2024. Our team will collaborate on GitHub for
proposal creation, using .Rmd to render the document as a GitHub
document for submission.</p>

<p>MTA reports that there is 63 out of 423 subway stations provide
restrooms 7am - 7pm and in restroom_df that we imported from NYC Open
Data, only 1047 restroom were marked as in the location of subway out of
5 recorded restrooms.</p>
