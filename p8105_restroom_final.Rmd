### Operational Restrooms Across NYC
Although public restrooms are readily available to us, they are not always usable. This could be due to malfunctions of the restroom or the entirety of the restroom is closed due to the location being closed for holiday or for the season. Analyzing the available of operational restrooms in NYC may help to prevent individuals from going to public restroom while worrying it may not be available.

#### The intended final products 
Webpage:

* Home page describing the project and data set 
* Second page showing the data visualization comparing operational restrooms of one condition to another 
* Third page mapping out available operational restrooms
* Fourth page with a report describing any findings or next steps of the project 

Our final product will be a comprehensive webpage with four main sections: an introduction to the project and dataset, data visualizations comparing restroom conditions, an interactive map of operational restrooms, and a detailed report with findings and future recommendations. This will allow users to explore restroom accessibility and discover patterns in restroom availability across different areas of NYC. 


#### The anticipated data sources 
* NYC Open Data: Public Restrooms 
* NOAA data from the class webpage 

#### The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges 
* Create a data visualization that maps out the operational restrooms for all the locations using the latitude and longitude data available * Create data visualization that maps out the operational restrooms across the different NYC train stations 
    * This will use both the NYC Open Data and the NOAA data set 
    * This may result in a challenge of finding which column to join the two datasets at 
* Compare the number of operational restrooms based on different restroom locations 
* Compare the number of operational restrooms based on gender and ACA accessibility 

We will source our data from NYC Open Data on Public Restrooms and the NOAA dataset from our class resources. Planned analyses will include mapping operational restrooms by location using latitude and longitude, visualizing accessibility across NYC train stations, and comparing restrooms by accessibility and gender accommodations. A significant challenge may be aligning columns from the two datasets for accurate analysis.

#### The planned timeline 
* Understanding and tidying data set --> Potentially by the end of 11/22/2024 
* Data visualization --> Potentially by the end of 11/30/2024 
* Webpage --> Potentially by the end of 12/06/2024 
* Screencast --> Potentially by the end of 12/12/2024 

Our timeline includes completing data tidying by 11/22/2024, visualizations by 11/30/2024, the webpage by 12/06/2024, and a recorded presentation by 12/12/2024. Our team will collaborate on GitHub for proposal creation, using .Rmd to render the document as a GitHub document for submission.
