### Operational Restrooms Across NYC

Although public restrooms are readily available to us, they are not
always usable. This could be due to malfunctions of the restroom or the
entirety of the restroom is closed due to the location being closed for
holiday or for the season. Analyzing the available of operational
restrooms in NYC may help to prevent individuals from going to public
restroom while worrying it may not be available.

#### The intended final products

Webpage:

- Home page describing the project and data set
- Second page showing the data visualization comparing operational
  restrooms of one condition to another
- Third page mapping out available operational restrooms
- Fourth page with a report describing any findings or next steps of the
  project

#### The anticipated data sources

- NYC Open Data: Public Restrooms
- NOAA data from the class webpage

#### The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

- Create a data visualization that maps out the operational restrooms
  for all the locations using the latitude and longitude data available
  \* Create data visualization that maps out the operational restrooms
  across the different NYC train stations
  - This will use both the NYC Open Data and the NOAA data set
  - This may result in a challenge of finding which column to join the
    two datasets at
- Compare the number of operational restrooms based on different
  restroom locations
- Compare the number of operational restrooms based on gender and ACA
  accessibility
