# Data

The data for our project was sourced from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Public-Restrooms/i7jb-7jku/about_data) and the NYC Transit Data that was shared with the p8105 for homework assignment two.


## Data Dictionary
The raw public restroom and train station dataset we utilized can be found [here](https://github.com/816dramaaddict/p8105_restroom_final.github.io/tree/main/Data), and the zip code data we utilized can be found [here](https://github.com/816dramaaddict/p8105_restroom_final.github.io/tree/main/NYC). Our cleaned merged dataset of the public restroom and train station datasets, available on our project [github](https://github.com/816dramaaddict/p8105_restroom_final.github.io/tree/main/Data), has 356 observations.
